# Professional README Generator
This is part of Challenge 10 - TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR for my UT Bootcamp Full Stack program.

## Built With
This application was built with NODE, Inquirer, JEST, and FS for functionality. BULMA CSS was used for styling and framework.

## How to Run the Code
Once the software is downloaded install Node, Inquirer, JEST, and BULMA. Then, in the command line type 'node index.js' to run the application. Links to documentation for those external packages are located within their respective files for reference.

## How to Test the Code
Once JEST is installed, refer to the command line and type 'npm test' to return passing tests.

## Contributions
This was largely an independent project that relied heavily on documentation, trial and error, and the challenge documentation. I referenced the challenge for similar functions and the module for help with ASYNC and AWAIT.

## Observations and Challenges
This project was started late, but took way too long outside of that. I must have tried every combination of JS and HTML functionality out there. I truly understand what is supposed to happen when I talk it out, but translating it from 'Plain English' to code is so difficult for me when I started mixing up syntaxes. I'm hoping with my commit history you can see the things I've tried to make this work, but when I would get one (1) part to work the other would fail. There is a very obvious connection error between the two functions and I don't understand it.

I met with my Tutor about this and she gave me a lot of pointers to make this work, but the working version I showed in the video would only take one (1) response. It was not dynamic enough.

## Future Development
Get the prompt inputs to accurately reflect in the HTML code.
